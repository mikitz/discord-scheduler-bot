# Discord Scheduler Bot
This is a self-hosted Discord bot that handles scheduling. Built with the intention to handle scheduling and RSVPs for D&amp;D 5e sessions on the 3 servers for the 3 campaigns I run.

## Features
- Have *Checkmark*, *Red X* reactions for Players
- Have *Cancel*, *Edit* reaction for Admin
  - Notify server on edit
- Set a minimum number of players to confirm
  - Auto cancel if a set number cannot attend
- Set a deadline to RSVP before auto-canceling
  - Remind Players who haven't confirmed or denied at a set frequency or only once at some interval before the session
- Recurring events
- Notify the server when a session is canceled or confirmed
